If you remove a floppy disk during reading, the program will exit with a
SIGBUS error. Not so kind of it, uhu?

It all occupies just too much memory. Moreover, it's mlock()ed, so the
program lives always on the edge... :(

If you open the pref windows and press OK without change anything, the file
becomes saveable even if you didn't actually make any modify. I'm sorry, but
the severity of the problem isn't worth the complexity of the fix, IMHO.

When opening files with non-latin1 filenames, the title of the window in some
cases (i.e. in RH 8.0+) won't display properly. This seems to be more GTK+ than
Gringotts-related.
